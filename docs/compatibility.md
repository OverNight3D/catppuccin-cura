# Compatible / Tested Cura versions

Due to how the theme and Cura are set up at the time of writing, there is no clear way to make the theme 100% backwards compatible.\
I would argue you have little to no reasons  to not upgrade a software like Cura, but some users may find themselves [unable to upgrade](https://support.makerbot.com/s/article/1667337917781); therefore, a table is provided below of the tested versions and systems

## Versions
